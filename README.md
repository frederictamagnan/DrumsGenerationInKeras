# DrumsGenerationInKeras
adaption of the [Vibert Thio's Model](https://github.com/vibertthio/drum_generation) in keras for further exportation in tensorflowjs
I used also some functions and the coding architecture of Twairball's (https://github.com/twairball/keras_lstm_vae/blob/master/lstm_vae/vae.py)

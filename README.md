# Drums Generation in Keras - Variational Auto Encoder with GRU Layers
Adaption of the [Vibert Thio's Variational Auto Encoder Model](https://github.com/vibertthio/drum_generation) in keras for further exportation in tensorflowjs.
Also I use some functions and the coding architecture of [Twairball's model](https://github.com/twairball/keras_lstm_vae/blob/master/lstm_vae/vae.py). 

This model is supposed to be trained on the [LPD](https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset) dataset to generate 1 bar drums pattern with 9 instruments.
